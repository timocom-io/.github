# Hi! 

**Welcome to TIMOCOM's collaboration space for devs and techies.**

We love roads. They bring people closer, connect the city and the countryside, break through borders: they are the glue that holds the world together. We bring those who work in logistics closer, making sure that road transport is smart, safe and simple. We are a trailblazer and pioneer, paving the way for a networked logistics industry. Our founder believed that the logistics industry required smarter, digitalised, international solutions, so he founded a daring start-up in Erkrath (close to Düsseldorf). That was how the TIMOCOM marketplace got started – and today we are one of the most successful mid-sized IT and data specialists serving the logistics industry in Europe, and one of the most popular IT companies to work for in Germany. But we aren’t just resting on our laurels: we are constantly expanding the TIMOCOM marketplace, adding new, cutting edge digital solutions, designed to ensure that our customers can continue to keep the world moving, both today and in the future.

Here we make a part of our software available to you.

If you are curious or even want to participate, feel invited. If you want to leave feedback, it is welcome. We're looking forward to it.
